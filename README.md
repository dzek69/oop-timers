# oop-timers

`oop-timers` are OOP timers (timeout and interval) for JavaScript. If you need to clear timeouts a lot and don't want
keep track of timers id and passing them to clearTimeout - this library is for you.

I bet you probably have written such class few times already, copying and pasting it over various projects or rewritting
each time. As noone published such code yet - I just did, so you don't have to.
