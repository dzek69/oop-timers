# oop-timers

`oop-timers` are OOP timers (timeout and interval) for TypeScript and JavaScript. If you need to clear timeouts a lot
and don't want to keep track of timers id and passing them to clearTimeout - this library is for you.

I bet you probably have written such class few times already, copying and pasting it over various projects or rewriting
each time. As no one published such code yet - I just did, so you don't have to.
